<p>This a project for a class of signal processing. This is a simple game, inspired by Froggit, where you must evade the cars.</p>
<p>The game is pretty simple, with only a 2 buttons, an LCD screen, and a piezo buzzer, but it was made in a relatively small time.</p>
<p>The interesting part in it was when we transposed our code from TinkerCad to our Arduino, as I had to do adjustments to the code for it to work flawlessly.</p>
<p>The project also allowed me to work again with 3D printers, which was very interesting. The name of the project comes from it, as I printed a Black Box to fit the components in it.</p>
