<p>This is a Taiwanese mini flute. It was used by aboriginal people to send messages across the huge mountains and deep valley of the island. The flute is only able do a range.</p>

<p>There are around twenty aboriginal Taiwanese tribes recognised by their government. Recently some historians started to research their ancestral instruments, prohibited during the Japanese occupation and the Chiang-Kai-shek dictatorship.</p>

<p>Like the picks, I decorated one of them with pyrography, but I don't have any pictures of it.</p>

<p>Here is one of them : </p>
