<p> When I started to try to learn guitar. The idea of creating my own picks emerged</p>
<p>I started doing it by using my plastic one as a patron.</p>
<p>My first attempts were made using only a knife not meant for this use, and I was afraid to make them too thin. And so they resulted in being highly impractical by too fat to be used correctly</p>
<p>But eventually, by sneaking in my father workshop, to borrow some tools, including a wood chisel, I managed to create planes thin enough. I then carved them in the shape of a pick.</p>
<p>I took the time to decorate some of them, as I got the tools meant for it. Despite the fact that I can't draw really well, as it isn't a skill I practiced.</p>

<p>As I wasn't very informed about it, I gave no finishing to my picks.</p>
<p>Here is the pictures of one decorated, and one blank :</p>

<p>On the recto of the decorated pick, I tried to represent an Ace of spades, on the verso, a Thunder strike.</p>
