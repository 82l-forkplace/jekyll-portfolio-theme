<p>This is final assignment of a class I followed to learn how to use Photoshop and Illustrator during my master</p>
<p>We were asked to do a game interface, and then do a mockup with it in a scene. We were tasked to show our skills</p>
<p>I killed to bird in one stone, as I was already working for the Blake and Mortimer video game project. I needed a cover for it, and I already did the research about the serials.</p>
<p>The design of the plane is completely taken from a drawing of the comics (credits to the rightful owners). I only added the planes in the background.</p>
<p>The scene of the mockup was one of those given by the teacher</p>
