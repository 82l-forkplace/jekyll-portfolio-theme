<p>In this team of 3, I was mainly in charge of doing some AI. Sadly as it was one of my first project from scratch in Unity, my scripts couldn't meet the deadlines, and where scrapped.</p>
<p>The game is about playing as a cute plush, who must find its master before he becomes totally asleep, to protect him from bad dreams</p>
<p>The plush, like in Toy Story movies, couldn't move in front of human. It was a kind of infiltration game.</p>
