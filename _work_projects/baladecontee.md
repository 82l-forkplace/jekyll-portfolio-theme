<p>This application is an audio-guide. It is the first app I developed for Opixido, in 2021. But due to problems with the client, it was only published on september 2022</p>
<p>The application is pretty straightforward. The goal of the app is to give information about the place to the user. The audio are narration driven, with comedians playing the role of the first owner of the auberge, and of the architect.</p>
<p>The application is in HTML5, packed with Ionic Capacitor</p>
<p>The main libraries are Leaflet, Mediaelement, swiper</p>
