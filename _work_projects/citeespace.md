<p>This application is a visit companion. The goal of this app is to present the activities of City of space, and accompany the user in his visit.</p>
<p>The data inside the app is managed with a CMS based on Opixido proprietary CMS</p>
<p>The app embarks multiple systems</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting all the data from the CMS, and saving it in the device storage</li>
<li>In-app alerts, managed in the CMS, to display urgent data to the user</li>
<li>Schedule of the activities, received and shaped by the CMS for the application</li>
<li>Waiting times for activities, a flux recuperated and shaped by the CMS in the Affluences API</li>
<li>Possibility for the user to set up a notification by choosing an activity schedule</li>
</ul>
<p>The app was packed with Ionic Capacitor.</p>
<p>It employs the js libraries of photoswipe and leaflet</p>
<p>I was a solo developer on this project, with help from my apprenticeship tutor. It was a strenuous project because of short deadlines, and a lot of post conception modifications</p>
