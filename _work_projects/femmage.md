<p>This application was created for the exposition "Parisiennes, Citoyennes".</p>
<p>The exposition was about the women who helped shape Paris and France as it is.</p>
<p>This device goal was to show how they were celebrated in public space. How very few monuments, road, or other urban elements were named after them 2 centuries ago, and how it evolved in the past 2 centuries.</p>
<p>This app includes a custom map, whose coordinates where calibrated using QGIS, and which is displayed using leaflet</p>
<p>The other library used is photoswipe.</p>
<p>I was a solo developer on this project, with help from my apprenticeship tutor. The project was smoothly made. I did not do the finishes as I left OPIXIDO before the end of it.
The hardest part being the evolution of the data displayed, based on the timeline. The data of the app was extracted from a sheet file.</p>
