<p>This project was done as a structure for a planning class, so the teacher could point out the problems in our workflow, and try to give us hardships as the client.</p>
<p>The exact task was to do a runner, with a twist. I came up with the idea of the color-swapping gameplay.</p>
<p>We worked as a two-man team. I've done the global game system, the controls, the inclusion of the designs, and a part of the menu, while my comrade worked on the platform generation.</p>
<p>During the project, the teacher imposed us the designs, but it was more a relief than a burden, because we didn't have any yet.</p>
<p>There is a few points I want to improve in the project, maybe when I'll get time : remove bugs, change the designs, rework the platform generation, drop one color button, add color mixes, and add responsive music.</p>
