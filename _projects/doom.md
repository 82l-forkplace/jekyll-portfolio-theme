<p>This game was designed as part of a course.</p>
<p>The goal was first to design a MCQ about the franchise chosen. 
Then give a mini-game for the ones who managed to get all correct answer</p>
<p>The goal of the leaderboard was to discriminate between the winners, and get their names</p>
<p>The leaderboard is made using request with the online free tool "Dreamlo Leaderboard"</p>
<p>Scorm was integrated to keep track of the users</p>
<p>We chose DOOM as the cultural product, because DOOM is cool.</p>
<p>To make DOOM a score-based mini-game, we decided to try to make it as a target shooter. The player can't move and must kill all the enemies coming towards him, and eventually die because of the damages taken.</p>
<p>In this project I worked with the UI, for the MCQ and the leaderboard, and the extraction and integration of the animations from the originals DOOM games.</p>
