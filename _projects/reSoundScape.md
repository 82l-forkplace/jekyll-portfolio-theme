<p>This is a project for a class about sound. The goal was to make a game around a sound interaction. We opted for this format, in which the player had to make its own sounds.</p>
<p>The gameplay is heavily inspired by the idea of having a soundscape.</p>
<p>We worked by pair, and came together with the idea.</p>
<p>I did all the programming in it, from custom events to the application of shaders.</p>
<p>The goal I set to myself was to try to use the ScriptableObjects to the maximum, following the precepts of this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raQ3iHhE_Kk">Unity Game Conference</a> about game architecture</p>
