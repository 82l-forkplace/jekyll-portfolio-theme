<p> This project was about making a simple map. Where the user could move. With different elements on it:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Rocks and trees, that the player couldn't pass</li>
 <li>Monster, who will harm the player life</li>
 <li>Traps, doing the same as the monster, but being invisible</li>
 <li>Coins, that the player needed to collect to finish the game</li>
 <li>Keys, with associated padlocks, and when you got a key, and go to the padlock, will give a coin</li>
</ul>
<p> I added, as a little bonus, randomness in generation. With a few checks to keep it controlled</p>
<p> The notation wasn't entirely about making the game. The teacher asked for a minor on the fly change in the code</p>
<p> I got the highest score</p>
