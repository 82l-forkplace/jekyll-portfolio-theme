<p>In this project, when it was in 2D I worked as a developer. Focusing on game and menu UI, and debug. I did a few things, but a lot of it was scraped for the 3D version.</p>
<p>Some of my work is still visible in the menus, and the animation of the victory screen. It was my first professional project on Unity, where I did learn a few things.</p>
