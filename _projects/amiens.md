<p>This project is on this portfolio because it is my first 3D experience.</p>
<p>The teacher gave us the 3D file of the cathedral, and tasked us to animate it by adding a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fps Controls</li>
<li>Lights</li>
<li>Points of interest, who opens a popup when you get near them</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these addons where to be made by us, in solo, without any help or roadmaps. I'm quite proud of the implementation of the head movements with the camera. And of the movements of the character, which where made by using trigonometry</p>
