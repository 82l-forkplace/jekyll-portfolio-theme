<p>This is a project made for an association, in "assimilation project" course</p>
<p>The association wanted to make an app concept to gain investment, for a campaign to stop middle and high schoolers from starting their first cigarette.</p>
<p>We proposed a system to create and update a visual novel app, based on the twine exports.</p>
<p>To do this, we used Twine, and our own coded format, with capacitor to transform it into a mobile app.</p>
<p>By using Twine and web technologies, we could have a responsive, functioning everywhere app, easily maintainable and updatable by the client.</p>
<p>The team was composed of eight people, all developers. My part in it was the setup of capacitor, and the occasional counseling.</p>
<p>The project was made on a tight schedule, and most of it was taken by the research of a good concept and all the solutions available.</p>
