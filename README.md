# From Jekyll-Uno-Timeline to Porfolio with projects as cards
Custom jekyll theme. Aimed at game devs and people with a lot of diverse projects.
Design is based on scalability: easy to add projects and categories.

The template is very much alive has it got a few iterations over the years.
Basically every time I need to add a project ðŸ˜“, and I do plan to keep expanding it.
